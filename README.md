# Quantitative Trading System Designed in C++

im_not_real

## 1. Design Concept and Purpose

In modern financial systems, many trading systems have been developed based on high-efficiency, high-performance computer designs. The high-performance computing capabilities of computers allow trading systems to more accurately capture changes in the financial markets, thus increasing the chances of achieving profitability. Among high-level programming languages, C++ is often used to build trading systems due to its high performance and low latency characteristics.

## 2. Overall Project Framework

The source code consists of three categories: trading classes, logging classes, and data retrieval classes. The decision to trade is based on a moving average trading strategy, among others. Detailed comments explaining the code will be provided, so they will not be elaborated on here.

## 3. Project Advantages

This project is based on a moving average trading strategy, which is grounded in economics and probability theory, helping to conduct systematic quantitative trading. The project has initially implemented automation, requiring only simple initialization by the user to automatically conduct simulated trading. A transaction history recording system has been specially designed for the project.

## 4. Issues and Solutions

The purpose of this project is to create a high-performance trading system; however, it does not implement high-frequency computation, meaning the C++ language features are not fully leveraged. Due to limitations in the authorâ€™s knowledge of algorithms and finance, it is not possible to design a more efficient algorithm. The focus instead is on developing a more scientifically sound and efficient trading strategy.

## 5. Operating Environment

On the local environment: (Windows 11, Visual Studio 2022 with ISO C++14 standard) the code can be compiled and run successfully. It is recommended to use at least C++11 or higher to avoid unexpected errors during local execution.
